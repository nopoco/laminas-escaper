> Removed political appeal incompatible with free software here. The original repository is at this [link](https://github.com/laminas/laminas-escaper).

The OWASP Top 10 web security risks study lists Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in
second place. PHPâ€™s sole functionality against XSS is limited to two functions
of which one is commonly misapplied. Thus, the laminas-escaper component was written.
It offers developers a way to escape output and defend from XSS and related
vulnerabilities by introducing contextual escaping based on peer-reviewed rules.
